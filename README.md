i needed to bulk convert a bunch of TIFF files into JPG files

of course if i did it manually it would've taken me 20mins or more...
so might as well spend up to half hour writing this script, ao that it can auto-convert hundreds more in 10sec instead.

worked off of a prev repo... but the library has been updated bc tech improvements.
